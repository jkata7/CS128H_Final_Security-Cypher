Here are the instructions:
In the first box, type a sequence of 20 distinct lowercase alphabets. This is the plugboard configuration in the enigma. 
Next, type three integer values between 1 and 26 in the next three boxes. These are the rotor configurations.
Finally, type in what you would like to encode and hit submit. 
To decode, use the same plugboard and rotor configurations and simply type in the encoded text into the same box where you would type the text you want to encode.

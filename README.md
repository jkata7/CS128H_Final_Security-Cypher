# CS128H_Final_Security-Cypher

Group Name: (Team)^2

Group members: 

Jiri Kataman-Kustwan(jkata7)

Naren Suresh(narens4)

# Project Introduction:

Our Goal is to create a cipher that will enable more secure communication between two parties sharing sensitive information. While both of us have prior experience in highschool designing an algorithm related to security. Jiri has had zero experience with c++ or rust prior.

## Technical Overview

The cipher will consist of two main components:

A monoalphabetic substitution cipher (maps every letter to another letter in the alphabet), and a transposition cipher (rearranges the letters in a word). The monoalphabetic cipher will further consist of two components: an affine cipher, and a cipher that Naren made inspired by the traditional Atbash cipher (reversed alphabet cipher).

## CheckPoint One:
Since each component of the cipher is independent from the other, it is best to test and develop both the encryption and decryption for each component one by one.

Develop and test all the components of the substitution cipher (including encryption and decryption of both components)
## CheckPoint Two:
Develop and test the transposition cipher.

## List of Possible Challenges:
-We will need to develops skills in relation to using github commands
-Interacting with rust crates

# Project Introduction:

Our Goal is to help make comminucation more efficent, and safer by desging an algorithim that creates a cypher for a secret message. While both of us have prior experience in highschool designing an algorithm related to security. Jiri has had zero experience with c++ or rust prior.

## Technical Overview


## CheckPoint One:
Designing then implementing nessicary framework functions for Encryption
## CheckPoint Two:
Testing and additional functions for reversing the encryption proccess

## List of Possible Challenges:
-We will need to develops skills in relation to using github commands
-Interacting with rust crates
